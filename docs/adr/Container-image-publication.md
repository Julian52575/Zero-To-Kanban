### Discussion

### Date

2026-09-07

### Context

The only way to use the released application is by downloading/cloning a release tag.
Uploading a build image allows app running without accessing the source code, which enhance security on servers.

### Options

1. Keep as is
2. Build and upload a container image to GitHub Container Registry (recommended)
3. Build and upload a container image to Docker Hub

### Decision

Accepted

### Justification

GitHub Container Registry is already a part of our GH repository.

### Consequences

A workflow will run whenever a release is created.

### Impact size

Small -- hours

### References
